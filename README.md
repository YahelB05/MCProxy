# MCProxy - MCP Proxy for RESTful APIs

MCProxy easley and almost seamlessly generates and deploys a proxy between your <b>existing</b> API and the clients.
<br />
It won't replace the existing interface with the existing API, but it will extend the functionality of your system
with <b>MCP</b>.
<br />

## What's MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standardized communication protocol that enables AI tools and services to interact
seamlessly,
where servers expose operations (‚Äútools‚Äù) with defined input/output schemas and clients can discover, invoke, and use
them dynamically.
<br />
In this ecosystem, an MCP Server acts as a gateway, exposing AI capabilities, workflows, or APIs‚Äîoften with streaming
outputs‚Äîwhile an MCP Client, typically an AI agent or application, discovers and calls these tools to perform tasks.
<br />
<br />
<b>MCProxy</b> acts as an MCP Server proxy layer that wraps your existing REST API, enabling AI clients to interact with
your services using the MCP protocol without changing your underlying API.

## Deployment

Deploying **MCProxy** is straightforward:

1. **Build the Docker image:**  
   `docker build -t mcp-proxy:<version> .`

2. **Prepare the configuration file**  
   Define the endpoints you want to expose to MCP clients. By default, MCProxy will look for `config.json`.

3. **Mount the configuration file**  
   Mount it into your Docker container, Kubernetes pod, or deployment.

4. **Expose MCProxy**  
   Make the service accessible via your preferred routing or ingress method.

üí° You can check the examples in `./dev/` for inspiration on configuration and setup.

Once deployed, MCP clients can connect to MCProxy and access exactly the data you‚Äôve allowed ‚Äî **no extra coding
required**.

## Testing

Set up the environment, including:

- **Nginx** as the reverse proxy (BSD 2-Clause License)
- **mendhak/http-https-echo** as the RESTful API (MIT License)
- The **MCProxy** server

```commandline
cd ./dev/deployment/docker
docker compose up -d
```

To test the default configuration, you can use the available scripts, for example:

```commandline
cd ./dev/scripts
python3 test_list_tools.py
```

<b>Note:</b> Both Nginx and http-https-echo are used only in the example Docker Compose setup and are not bundled with
this project.
